Problem Scenario for Ferozsons Pharmaceuticals – Portfolio Project Overview
Project Overview: Ferozsons Pharmaceuticals, a leading pharmaceutical company, is facing significant challenges in managing its inventory, orders, and supplier relationships due to inefficiencies in its internal database system. The database, which was designed to streamline operations and improve decision-making, has exposed gaps in real-time data accuracy and process coordination. These issues are now impacting the company’s ability to meet customer demands, fulfill orders on time, and efficiently manage product restocking from suppliers.
Key Challenges:
1.	Inventory Management: The current system lacks real-time updates to the inventory, resulting in stockouts and unfulfilled orders. Products marked as "available" in the database are often found to be out of stock during order processing, leading to customer dissatisfaction.
2.	Order Processing Delays: Due to incomplete and outdated information in the orders and order details tables, the company is experiencing frequent delays in order fulfillment. This is compounded by payment processing issues, causing further delays in shipping and customer service.
3.	Supplier and Restocking Inefficiencies: Outdated supplier data makes it difficult for the procurement department to maintain consistent stock levels. In addition, a lack of integration between new product data and suppliers is causing delays in restocking critical products.
4.	Interdepartmental Coordination: Departments responsible for sales, procurement, and warehouse operations lack proper coordination. As a result, there is confusion around prioritizing orders and maintaining accurate stock records.
Project Outcome: In this portfolio project, the Ferozsons Pharmaceuticals database was designed and implemented using SQL Server to simulate a real-world enterprise resource planning (ERP) scenario. The project focused on creating a comprehensive database structure, including tables for customers, employees, products, orders, inventory, payments, suppliers, and more. The key objective was to provide a solution that could be scaled for better management of the company’s internal operations, specifically improving order accuracy, inventory tracking, and supplier coordination.
This database implementation and analysis demonstrate an understanding of data management challenges in a business setting and provide practical solutions for streamlining operations, which are essential skills for any data specialist role .
