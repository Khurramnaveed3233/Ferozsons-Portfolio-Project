# Project Overview

Ferozsons Pharmaceuticals, a leading pharmaceutical company, faced inefficiencies in its internal database system, affecting inventory management, order processing, supplier coordination, and interdepartmental communication. This project aimed to redesign and optimize the database using SQL Server to improve real-time data accuracy and streamline operations.

# Key Challenges & Solutions

1. Inaccurate Inventory Records
   
    -   Problem: Outdated stock data caused stockouts and unfulfilled orders.
    -   Solution: Implemented an SQL trigger to update inventory levels in real-time when new orders are placed.
    -   SQL Query: Automatically reduces stock quantity upon order confirmation.
  
2. Order Processing Delays
   
    -   Problem: Unpaid or incomplete orders caused shipping delays.
    -   Solution: Created a report identifying pending orders so the team could take action.
    -   SQL Query: Fetches orders where payment is incomplete to prioritize processing.

3. Supplier & Restocking Inefficiencies

    -   Problem: Poor supplier data management led to delays in restocking critical products.
    -   Solution: Designed an SQL query to identify low-stock products and prioritize suppliers with the fastest delivery times.
    -   SQL Query: Fetches products running low on stock along with supplier details.

4. Interdepartmental Coordination Breakdown
   
    -   Problem: Lack of communication between sales, procurement, and warehouse teams led to order fulfillment delays.
    -   Solution: Developed a report tracking pending orders and assigned responsibilities.
    -   SQL Query: Lists pending orders with the responsible department for better coordination.

5. Delayed Payments Affecting Shipping
   
   -    Problem: Orders held up due to pending payments, impacting customer satisfaction.
   -    Solution: Created an SQL alert to notify the finance team of outstanding payments.
   -    SQL Query: Identifies orders pending due to payment issues to expedite resolution.
