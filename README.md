## 📘 Project Overview

Ferozsons Pharmaceuticals, a prominent healthcare company, faced serious challenges due to data silos, delayed processing, and outdated supplier and inventory records. This project simulates a **real-time ERP system** using SQL Server to improve internal operations across departments such as Sales, Procurement, Finance, and Inventory.

The goal was to design a normalized database and implement SQL-based solutions that:
- Increase inventory accuracy
- Reduce order delays
- Optimize supplier restocking
- Enhance interdepartmental coordination

## 🚨 Business Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Inaccurate Inventory Records  
**Problem:** Inventory showed "Available" for items that were actually out of stock.  
**Solution:**  
- Introduced **triggers** to automatically deduct inventory quantities when orders are placed.
- Ensures inventory reflects real-time stock levels and prevents overselling.

### 2. Order Processing Delays  
**Problem:** Orders were delayed due to unpaid or partially paid invoices.  
**Solution:**  
- Built **reporting queries** to flag orders stuck due to payment issues.
- Enables the processing team to prioritize and resolve these issues promptly.

### 3. Supplier & Restocking Inefficiencies  
**Problem:** Lack of updated supplier data led to delayed restocking.  
**Solution:**  
- Developed a **supplier prioritization query** that recommends suppliers based on delivery performance and product availability.

### 4. Interdepartmental Coordination Breakdown  
**Problem:** Sales, finance, and warehouse teams were not aligned on order status.  
**Solution:**  
- Designed a **status tracking report** to show pending orders along with the responsible departments.
- Improves accountability and communication across teams.

### 5. Delayed Payments Affecting Shipping  
**Problem:** Orders ready to ship were blocked due to outstanding payments.  
**Solution:**  
- Implemented a **financial alert system** using queries that notify finance about critical payment holds affecting shipments.
