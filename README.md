Project Overview

Ferozsons Pharmaceuticals, a leading pharmaceutical company, faced inefficiencies in its internal database system, affecting inventory management, order processing, supplier coordination, and interdepartmental communication. This project aimed to redesign and optimize the database using SQL Server to improve real-time data accuracy and streamline operations.

Key Challenges & Solutions

1. Inaccurate Inventory Records
   
  - **Problem: Outdated stock data caused stockouts and unfulfilled orders.**
  
Solution: Implemented an SQL trigger to update inventory levels in real-time when new orders are placed.
SQL Query: Automatically reduces stock quantity upon order confirmation.
