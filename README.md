Project Overview:

In this project, I designed and implemented an SQL Server database for Ferozsons Pharmaceuticals, addressing key operational challenges in inventory management, order processing, and supplier coordination. 
Ferozsons, a leading pharmaceutical company, faced issues due to inefficiencies in their internal database system. These issues affected their ability to meet customer demands, fulfill orders, and efficiently manage restocking from suppliers.

Key Challenges:

Inventory Management: The existing system lacked real-time inventory updates, leading to frequent stockouts and unfulfilled orders, ultimately affecting customer satisfaction.
Order Processing Delays: Outdated and incomplete order data caused delays in processing orders, shipping, and payments.
Supplier and Restocking Inefficiencies: Outdated supplier information and lack of integration between product and supplier data led to restocking delays for critical products.
Interdepartmental Coordination: Lack of coordination between sales, procurement, and warehouse teams resulted in confusion regarding prioritization of orders and accurate stock maintenance.

Project Outcome:
This portfolio project involved designing and developing a comprehensive SQL database to simulate a real-world ERP system. Key database tables were created for:

Customers
Employees
Products
Orders
Inventory
Payments
Suppliers

The database provided a scalable solution to improve:

Order accuracy
Real-time inventory tracking
Supplier coordination
Key Skills Demonstrated:
SQL Server database design for business operations
